# Consumer-Behavior-prediction-using-Machine-Learning
In this project , the targeted one was the online shoppers. The project was built for the prediction of consumer behavior like how frequently they bought items, how much time they visited the site , how many times they left without buying and many more. This project was  built using Machine Learning algorithms like Random Forest , Decision Tree and Naive Bayes and at the end all the result are concluded that which algorithms gives the best accuracy for prediction of consumer behavior.
